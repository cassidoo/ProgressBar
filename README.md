Progress Bar Magic
=================

##What

A bunch of progress bars made with some magic CSS and JavaScript magic.  And jQuery.  We'll see how well this goes.

##Why

Because I haven't found a lot of good ones out there.  So why not make one.  For the people.

##How

I'll tell you when I'm finished.

So far, there are 5 styles of bars that people can use:

* Default
* Battery
* Pill
* Shiny Pill (I'm really creative with names)
* Skinny
